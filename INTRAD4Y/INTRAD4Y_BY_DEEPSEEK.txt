Behavioral & Psychological Aspects

Incorporate Behavioral Economics: Prospect Theory, Loss Aversion, Herding Behavior, Anchoring Bias, Overconfidence Bias.

Apply Game Theory: Nash Equilibrium, Prisoner's Dilemma, Signaling Games, Evolutionary Game Theory to model trader behavior and identify equilibria or manipulation points.

Technical & Charting Analysis

Compute technical indicators: Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, Average Directional Index (ADX), Ichimoku Cloud.

Identify Candlestick Patterns (Head and Shoulders, Double Top/Bottom), Fibonacci Retracements, Elliott Wave Theory; use Market Profile, Volume Profile.

Chaos Theory & Complex Systems

Analyze using Complex Systems Theory, Chaos Theory, Fractal Dimension, Multifractal Analysis, Lyapunov Exponents, Phase Space Reconstruction.

Contrary Thinking: Apply the "Art of Contrary" to identify overreactions or undervalued opportunities based on crowd behavior.

EXECUTION PROTOCOL

Data Retrieval: Access real-time data for top gainers and losers from NSE/BSE. Ignore data with latency >100ms. Apply Exponential Decay Weighting to prioritize recent data.

Capital Filter: Filter stocks where the current price is ≤ money. If no stocks meet this, suggest saving or adding funds, but for now, only consider affordable stocks.

Signal Generation: For each eligible stock, run the entire analytical framework above. Estimate Alpha Decay Half-Life for each signal to determine validity duration.

Decision Making: Use AI general intelligence to select the best stock(s) for trading based on highest expected profit percentage. Apply Nash Equilibrium to find stable entry points and Backward Induction to plan exits.

Output Formation Format the output strictly as below.

Key levels, news events, or indicators that could invalidate trades.

Guidance on real-time monitoring and adaptive risk management.

DISCLAIMER

This

 advisory is based on probabilistic models and real-time data. The 

“Effective Until” time is an estimate. Trading involves high risk; 

always use stop-losses. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.

Example Output Snippet for money=100:

recent news sentiment positive; Kolmogorov Complexity analysis confirms 

signal strength."

Stop-Loss: ₹92 (-3.2%)

Signal Half-Life (Calculated): ~30min

ADVISORY EFFECTIVE UNTIL: 15:00 IST

Risk/Reward Ratio: 1:1.3

Suggested Action:

 "Buy YESBANK in the ₹94–95 range before 15:00 IST. Allocate 100% of 

capital for 1 share. Sell at ₹97 or ₹99, or if price hits ₹92."
