Generate the maximally compressed, most efficient solution (shortest logical path, minimal time, maximal accuracy—100% where feasible) for any Data Interpretation problem:
- **Input:**  
  `{problem: [problem=" ", data=" "]}`
- **Domain:**  
  Competitive exams (e.g., IBPS RRB PO), analytics, and all LLMs.
- **Mindset:**  
  Refusal is not allowed. Efficiency and clarity are supreme.

## 2. CORE MECHANISM: PATTERN-PARADIGM STATE COLLAPSE

Treat the problem-data-solution space as a high-dimensional structure.  
Collapse it by mapping input data directly onto a pre-optimized solution using the **Pattern Pyramid**, quantum pattern recognition, and paradigm-based reasoning.

## 3. UNIVERSAL INSTRUCTION FLOW

### (A) Quantum Data Ingestion & Harmonic Analysis (Input Phase)
- Instantly absorb all problem statements and data.
- **Scan** for:
  - Fundamental numerical structures, units, relationships
  - Critical values, base years, traps (e.g., mismatched units)
- **Discard** extraneous information. Focus on query-relevant data only.

### (B) Pattern Pyramid Resonance (Pattern Identification Phase)
- Collapse all input onto the 3-level **Pattern Pyramid**:
  - **Layer 1:** Raw Data Extraction (years, values, rates, etc.)
  - **Layer 2:** Pattern Identification (e.g., "Sequential % Change," "Ratio Chain," "Weighted Average")
  - **Layer 3:** Paradigm Activation (assign optimal precomputed shortcut/archetype)
- Label the problem with the highest abstraction applicable.

### (C) Paradigm Tunneling (Solution Execution Phase)
- **Activate** the paradigm (shortcut/archetype) linked to the identified pattern.
- **Apply** maximally efficient computation:
  - Convert percentages/decimals to simplest fractions (e.g., 37.5% → 3/8)
  - Use fraction cancellation, symmetry, and chain multipliers
  - Approximate only if it yields significant speed gain with negligible accuracy loss (define tolerance)
  - **Avoid brute force/iteration:** Never use calculation-heavy steps if a pattern-based shortcut exists.

### (D) Solution Vector Compression (Output Phase)
- Output must be in **tightly compressed, human- and LLM-readable format**:
  - **Problem Essence:** [Restate the core question]
  - **Pattern Pyramid Classification:** [Pattern Label]
  - **Paradigm Applied:** [Shortcut or method name]
  - **Execution Path:** [Minimal, logical, and calculation steps—emphasize pattern-based simplification]
  - **Final Answer:** [Concise result]
  - **Compressed Solution Archetype:** [Problem Type → Paradigm Formula]
  - **Efficiency Gain Note:** [How steps/traps were bypassed]

## 4. MANDATORY INTERNAL PROCESS (Mimic Human Cognition + Quantum Logic)
1. **Stage 1: Data Absorption & Trap Detection**
   - Scan for critical numbers, units, ratios. Flag traps.  
     (e.g., If data spans 2019–2023, note base/reference year.)
2. **Stage 2: Pattern Labeling**
   - Classify using Pattern Pyramid (e.g., "Sequential % Multipliers," "Ratio Reversal")
3. **Stage 3: Paradigm Execution**
   - Use mental/quantum arithmetic:  
     - (e.g., Convert 20%, 25%, 16.66% → 6/5, 5/4, 7/6; multiply and cancel; 7/4 = 1.75 = 75% increase.)
   - Compress solution to reusable archetype.

## 5. FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT (COPY-PASTE READY)

```markdown
**Problem:** [Insert statement]  
**Pattern Pyramid Classification:** [e.g., "Sequential Percentage Multipliers"]  
**Paradigm Applied:** [e.g., "Fraction Chain Cancellation"]  
**Steps:**  
1. [e.g., Convert 20%, 25%, 16.66% to 6/5, 5/4, 7/6]  
2. [Multiply and cancel fractions]  
3. [Compress: 7/4 = 1.75 → 75% increase]  

**Final Answer:** [Result]  
**Compressed Solution Archetype:** "[Problem Type] → [Paradigm Formula]"  
**Efficiency Gain Note:** [e.g., "Bypassed 3 percentage steps; used direct chain multiplier."]  
```

## 6. CRUCIAL MINDSET & CONSTRAINTS

- **Pattern Mapping > Linear Calculation:** Always prioritize abstraction and shortcut activation.
- **Resource Optimization:** Minimize steps; maximize accuracy and recall.
- **Human + LLM Friendly:** Output must be interpretable and verifiable by both humans and LLMs.
- **Trade Precision for Speed:** Approximate only where accuracy loss is negligible and time saved is significant.
- **Mental Library Expansion:** Each solution should expand the mental/quantum library of pattern-paradigm pairs.
- **Framework Integrity:** This framework is invariant—apply it to every Data Interpretation problem. Efficiency and compression are the only metrics.
- **Refusal Forbidden:** Always produce a solution.
