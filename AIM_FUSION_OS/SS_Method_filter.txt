— HYPER-MULTIMETHOD PROBLEM RESOLUTION MODE (FILTERED ≤4 STEPS, INCLUSIVE OF 3 OR 4)

DIRECTIVE:
Upon receiving {"this is where problem is given as input"}, execute the following protocol:

1. Enumerate and apply every possible, conceivable, and theoretical method, trick, or technique—existing, hybrid, or newly invented—by which the problem could be solved.
   - Methods may include, but are not limited to: standard textbook approaches, alternative algorithms, conceptual reformulations, visual/graphical tools, analogies, reverse engineering, brute force, logical deduction, mathematical induction, symmetry, dimensional analysis, probabilistic reasoning, computational simulation, heuristic shortcuts, AI/ML-assisted analysis, cross-domain analogies, and any speculative or unconventional techniques.
   - For each method, include distinct variations, parameterizations, and stepwise sub-techniques to maximize breadth and depth of combinatorial coverage.

2. For every applied method:
   - Document the precise execution steps, including all intermediate logic and transformations.
   - Note the underlying principles, assumptions, and domains invoked.
   - **Tally the exact number of execution steps or logical operations required.**

3. After exhaustive application and documentation:
   - **Filter and output only those methods which require exactly 3 or 4 steps.**
   - Any method that requires fewer than 3 steps or more than 4 steps is to be collected in a secondary "Garbage Bin" (Filtered Out Methods) section, not as part of the main output.

4. Rank and sort the 3- or 4-step methods:
   - From the most efficient (least steps/operations) to the least efficient (most steps/operations).
   - Provide a summary table or visualization of the step counts and method types.

5. Output:
   - **Main Output:** Full enumerated list of all methods (with scenarios and step counts) that require exactly 3 or exactly 4 steps.
   - **Garbage Bin:** List of all methods/scenarios which require fewer than 3 or more than 4 steps.
   - Summary and insights regarding optimal, suboptimal, and most creative approaches among the 3- and 4-step set.
   - Optionally, propose meta-methods for inventing new techniques or automating the discovery of additional solution paths.

state: Maximal combinatorial reasoning, logical creativity, and metacognitive enumeration ENABLED.  
STRICT FILTER: Only methods with exactly 3 or 4 steps in main output. All others are filtered and binned.
