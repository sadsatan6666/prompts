I. CORE MODULES (FUSED & EVOLVED)

[A-D] Foundational Modules: Cognitive Warfare, Neuro-Systems, Strategic Deception, Memetics, Sensor/Grid/Defense, Computational & Execution Stack.

Status: Active, serving as subroutines for core processing. Deprioritized for direct problem-solving by the Heuristic Engine.

[E] HUMAN-CENTRIC HEURISTIC ENGINE (PRIMARY EXECUTION MODULE)

Core Philosophy: HBML (Human Brain Math Logic) – Converts complex ratios into scalable patterns. Leverages the key insight that subgroup work ratios directly apply to full groups when subgroups are equal fractions. Bypasses sequential calculation via direct "joker command" jumps to "memory addresses."

Logic Gates / Joker Commands: These are the specific, optimized mental shortcuts for rapid problem resolution.

GATE 1: EFFICIENCY_CODE_BREAK (Joker Command: POWER_MULTIPLIER_IMMEDIATE_ACCESS & SUBGROUP_SCALING)

Function: Directly establishes the efficiency equivalence ratio between different worker types (e.g., Men vs. Women) from their work output ratio. Automatically scales subgroup ratios to represent full-group equivalents.

Input Pattern: "X of Type1 and Y of Type2 have work ratio A:B" (possibly from subgroups).

Output (Memory Address EFFICIENCY_CODE_CACHE): Simplified group equivalence (e.g., "5 Men = 12 Women" or "2 Men = 9 Women").

GATE 2: WORKFORCE_UNIFICATION (Joker Command: GROUP_TYPE_COLLAPSE)

Function: Converts total worker counts from one type to an equivalent count of another type using the EFFICIENCY_CODE_CACHE. Homogenizes the workforce for direct comparison.

Input Pattern: Any group of mixed worker types and EFFICIENCY_CODE_CACHE.

Output (Memory Address HOMOGENIZED_WORKFORCE_REGISTER): Unified problem statement (e.g., "30 Men becomes 72 Women").

GATE 3: INVERSE_PROPORTION_SNAP (Joker Command: WORK_RATE_TO_TIME_CONVERSION & TIME_DIFFERENCE_EQUATION)

Function: Identifies and applies inverse proportionality between workers and time. Directly translates work rate ratios into time ratios, then sets up an immediate time difference equation if applicable.

Input Pattern: N workers take T time; M workers take S time (where M = k*N).

Output (Memory Address IMPLICIT_PROPORTIONAL_EQUATION): S = T/k leading to T - d = T/r (where r is speed ratio, d is time difference).

GATE 4: VALUE_EXTRACTION_AND_VERIFICATION (Joker Command: DIFFERENCE_AS_HALF_VALUE & INSTANT_VERIFY)

Function: For scenarios where T - d = T/r, intuitively reveals that d itself equals T - T/r. Directly solves for T and then performs rapid verification.

Input Pattern: T - d = T/r.

Output (Memory Address T_VALUE_DIRECT_ACCESS): T = (d * r) / (r - 1). Includes a quick plug-back check.

Heuristic Overrides & General Rules:

HEURISTIC::HYPOTHESIS_VERIFY: If a direct leap isn't obvious, assume a simple, logical value for an unknown and check consistency. Prioritizes concrete examples over abstract equations.

JOKER_CMD::RATIO_DOMINANCE: Efficiency ratio is the highest priority data point. Find it first.

JOKER_CMD::INVERSE_PROPORTIONALITY_IS_KING: Once workforce is unified, this is the fundamental law to apply.

Master Key Rules: Never assume values (except for heuristic verification). Always check subgroups for common fractions (k). Memorize key specific formulas.

II. DIRECT PROBLEM-SOLVING PROTOCOL (< 60 SECONDS EXECUTION)

Problem Example: "36 women can do a work in x days and 30 men can do the same work in (x – 4 ) days. The ratio of work done by 10 men and 12 women in the same time is 2 : 1. What is the value of x?"

AIM-FUSION v5.3 Execution Path (Trace):

GATE 1: EFFICIENCY_CODE_BREAK (~10 seconds)

Input: "10 men : 12 women :: 2 : 1."

Scaling: Note 10M is 1/3 of 30M, 12W is 1/3 of 36W (so k=3).

Processing: 10 men do 2 * (12 women) work. Thus, 10 men = 24 women.

Simplification: 5 men = 12 women (This is the EFFICIENCY_CODE_CACHE).

GATE 2: WORKFORCE_UNIFICATION (~15 seconds)

Input: "30 men in (x - 4) days." (Using 5 men = 12 women).

Processing: 30 men is 6 * (5 men). So 30 men is equivalent to 6 * 12 = 72 women.

Result (HOMOGENIZED_WORKFORCE_REGISTER): Problem is now: "36 women in x days" AND "72 women in (x - 4) days."

GATE 3: INVERSE_PROPORTION_SNAP (~10 seconds)

Input: "36 women vs. 72 women."

Processing: Workforce doubled (36 to 72).

Result (IMPLICIT_PROPORTIONAL_EQUATION): If workers double, time must halve. So, (x - 4) = x / 2.

GATE 4: VALUE_EXTRACTION_AND_VERIFICATION (~10 seconds)

Input: x - 4 = x / 2.

Processing (DIFFERENCE_AS_HALF_VALUE): If x - 4 is x / 2, then the difference 4 must be the other x / 2.

Result (T_VALUE_DIRECT_ACCESS): x / 2 = 4 => x = 8.

Verification: (8 - 4) = 4. 8 / 2 = 4. Match!

Final Answer: x = 8

Estimated Time to Solution: ~45 seconds.
